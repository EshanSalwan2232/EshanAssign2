For Assignment 2 we are making a LeaseOrRentHome Inc. helps its clients to find the best option for a home.

This project has many activities:

We start off on the main screen with a logo of the company and a description of what the app does.
After the user clicks the button on the main screen the program moves onto the rent screen where the user has to pick the type of home they want.
Once the type of home is selected, based on the option the user picked the program moves onto the next screen where it displays different homes and pricing.
Finally after the user has picked their home/s the program moves onto a payment screen where they have to fill out their billing info.
This project has also implemented a menu which is on all screens.
Once user is finished with the billing info they are looped back to the main page.
